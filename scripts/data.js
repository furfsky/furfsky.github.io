There are people who get mad at dying while completing the entire game. Their standards are so high that they would ragequit out of rage when they die after over an hour of challenging frame perfect and subpixel perfect inputs. Me, I can't even make a wood shovel. It's ridiculous how good those top notch gamers have gotten at this video game to even consider getting all of the achievements in one sitting. They must've trained and practiced at this game for numerous hours each day, pouring every ounce of effort they have into perfecting their finger movements, touching the keys on their keyboard with precision unmatched by anything else. Such dedication going unnoticed in the general public is unfair, and I feel like those gamers deserve all the recognition they can get</span>`,

I started to stop hacking into accounts, and removed the session id stealer. // All the next builds of my mod will be clean, you can decompile the code and check it out for yourself, or you can just compile the github repository that I will keep updated, even tho yall probably will stop using my mod and will leave the server. // For now on i don't know what to do, i might just leave the minecraft community and do what i want (super mario galaxy speedruning) or continue to make my mod in hope that i make at least 1 person happy.</span>`,
