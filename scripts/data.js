There are people who get mad at dying while completing the entire game. Their standards are so high that they would ragequit out of rage when they die after over an hour of challenging frame perfect and subpixel perfect inputs. Me, I can't even make a wood shovel. It's ridiculous how good those top notch gamers have gotten at this video game to even consider getting all of the achievements in one sitting. They must've trained and practiced at this game for numerous hours each day, pouring every ounce of effort they have into perfecting their finger movements, touching the keys on their keyboard with precision unmatched by anything else. Such dedication going unnoticed in the general public is unfair, and I feel like those gamers deserve all the recognition they can get</span>`,
